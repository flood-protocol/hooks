## Flood Hooks

This repo is a collection of Hooks and utilities that can be used with the Flood Protocol, some examples of hooks include:

- Bridging after a swap
- Unwrapping and Wrapping ETH
- Withdrawing / Depositing into a lending market
  etc...

Sometimes additional functionality has been added to hooks to provide an example of trading using smart contract signatures, this is the case for the `NativeTrader` hook for example.
